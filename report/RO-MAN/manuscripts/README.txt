- TODO:
	- (V) For Fig.2, draw a box around Char Net and Pred Net and label the box ToMnet+.
		- Replied the comment. Refused to draw such a box. Suggest revision of the figure caption instead.
	- (V) Make sure the range [0,26] is correct.
	- (V) Explain the difference between OG tomnet and tomnet+.
	- (V) The nomenclature of tau_j prime is a bit confusing, maybe use another symbol to express it is a subset?
	- (V) Maybe a figure could better convey the design of the network.
	- (V) Can this be more specific (exact %)?
	- (V) Why is Fig. 5 before Fig. 4?
  - (V) Revise the y axis text of Fig. 5 and 6. Should be 'Accuracy (%)'.
	- (V) Should fix the preference matrix for human. Replace with the updated figure.
	- (V) Fix the participant section. Should be 12 instead of 13 humans. Two of the humans played twice with different target set. So there are 14 human data sets.
