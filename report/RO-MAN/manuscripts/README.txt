- TODO:
	- (V) For Fig.2, draw a box around Char Net and Pred Net and label the box ToMnet+.

	- () Make sure the range [0,26] is correct.
	- (V) Explain the difference between OG tomnet and tomnet+.
	- (V) The nomenclature of tau_j prime is a bit confusing, maybe use another symbol to express it is a subset?
	- (V) Maybe a figure could better convey the design of the network.
	- () Can this be more specific (exact %)?
	- (V) Why is Fig. 5 before Fig. 4?
  - (V) Revise the y axis text of Fig. 5 and 6. Should be 'Accuracy (%)'.
