- my first draft of slides for ROMAN 2020 presentation.
- I sent it to Josh on 20200810.

presentation_v2_YS20200811.pptx
-------------------------
- revised based on Josh's comments which I received via gmail on 20200810.
  - (V) One suggestion would be to add a bit more background that links this work to Human-Robot interaction applications since this is RO-MAN. So maybe in slide 2 you might highlight how knowing the social network of agents might be important for a robot to know how to interact with humans. Either you can include some graphic of this in the slide or you might just talk about it in the video.
  - (X) In Slide 4, you might quickly side step to slide 8 quickly, then come back.
    - No need.
  - (V) Also, you might add animations so each panel of each slide is shown one panel at a time instead of the the whole slide at once. Then you just talk through each slide panel. Easier to digest.
  - (X) I was thinking maybe the Results in slide 5 could go back to the format you had in slide 2. ie. The rankings can be used to graphically project back into the social network (albeit with re-scaled edge weights of relative size).
    - No need.
