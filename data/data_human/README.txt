See the README file at 'models\working_model\test_on_human_data\' for 
	(1) details about where the data is on the server and how to log in.
		- "/var/www/html/bmlab/ai-robo/game/data"
	(2) how the raw data is converted to the processed data.
	Data source:
	(1) Sign in to server: ssh gibmsadmin@140.112.122.160 (pw: See https://gitlab.com/brain-and-mind-lab/notes-for-bml/bmlab-wiki-home/wikis/server#gibms_server%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6)
	(2) Data path: '/var/www/html/bmlab/ai-robo/game/data'
	(3) Note that the txt file is very similar to the simulated txt, except for
		- This is handled by '/scripts/convert_human_data_format/convert_human_data_format.R' to ensure the format of human data to be the same as the simulated data. See README there for details.
	(4) Use FileZilla SFTP to log in and download files

	Note:
	To derive the scores that participants see:
	(1) http://gibms.mc.ntu.edu.tw/phpmyadmin
	(2) See this for account name and password: https://gitlab.com/brain-and-mind-lab/notes-for-bml/bmlab-wiki-home/wikis/server#gibms_server%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6
	(3) bmlab/ai_social_game
	(4) Note that the scores that participants see = round(averaged score * (23/9)). The column 'agent1_value' shown is rounded, but the original value to derive the score is not rounded. Rounding occurs after *(23/9).

	'\data\data_human'
--------------------------------------------
raw/
--------------------------------------------
- the raw data downloaded from the server.

--------------------------------------------
processed/
--------------------------------------------
- the processed data that is used for model training.
- converted from raw data by 'scripts\convert_human_data_format\convert_human_data_format.R'

--------------------------------------------
filtered/
--------------------------------------------
- generated by 'tomnet-project\scripts\filter_full_targets_trajectories\filter_full_targets_trajectories.R'
- mazes with exact 4 targets. 
- This is based on the processed files. 
- This is better for preference inference because with all targets being present, the model will have sufficient information about all the 4 targers to make predictions on the query states.

--------------------------------------------
augmented/
--------------------------------------------
- based on 'processed' data.
- augment the data by flipping the maze by x and/or y axis.
- This will result in 4 times the original number of mazed.
? Maybe the filtered data should be based on this?
