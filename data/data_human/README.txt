See the README file at 'models\working_model\test_on_human_data\' for 
	(1) details about where the data is on the server.
	(2) how the raw data is converted to the processed data.
	
--------------------------------------------
raw/
--------------------------------------------
the raw data downloaded from the server.

--------------------------------------------
processed/
--------------------------------------------
the processed data that is used for model training.

--------------------------------------------
filtered/
--------------------------------------------
- generated by 'tomnet-project\scripts\filter_full_targets_trajectories\filter_full_targets_trajectories.R'
- mazes with exact 4 targets. 
- This is based on the processed files. 
- This is better for preference inference because with all targets being present, the model will have sufficient information about all the 4 targers to make predictions on the query states.

--------------------------------------------
augmented/
--------------------------------------------
- based on 'processed' data.
- augment the data by flipping the maze by x and/or y axis.
- This will result in 4 times the original number of mazed.
? Maybe the filtered data should be based on this?
