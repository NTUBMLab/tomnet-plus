- do the preference prediction for human data on the 'filtered' data.
- retrain:
	- (V)human: 
		- (V)retrain the model by complete human data set
	- simulated
		- retrain with different simulated data
		- try to augment the data as well
- (V)count the total playing time for all humans
	- (V)require re-download all the human files (so that the modified time is intact)
- 'all_training_results.pdf'
	- use bootstrapping to construct the error bars for each data point.
