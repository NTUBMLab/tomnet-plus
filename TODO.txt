- do the preference prediction for human data on the 'filtered' data.
- retrain:
	- human: 
		- retrain the model by complete human data set
	- simulated
		- retrain with different simulated data
		- try to augment the data as well
- count the total playing time for all humans
	- require re-download all the human files (so that the modified time is intact)
